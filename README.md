# Third-Party APIs-C5: Work Day Scheduler

With our current **busy schedules**, it is very easy to miss out on **important events** or even simple **tasks**. It is **crucial** to use some form of **planner** or **log** to help keep you **organized** and on task. 

### With this daily planner, you have access to the following:
* Current Date & Time
* Color Coded time blocks that represent if that current block's time is in the past, present, or future
  - **Grey**: Hour has Passed
  - **Red**: Current Hour
  - **Green**: Hour yet to come
* 9 Hour day blocks to add tasks or important events that will persist after refreshing the page

>I was tasked with creating a calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the business day. Each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past (Grey), present (Red), or future (Green).
